The purpose of the global network is to ease the accessing of the database through building a NetworkX DiGraph. Defines a set of convenience functions performing tasks related to traversing the data in the database.

The nodes of the graph correspond to a producer and consist of 
their unique (string) name. The edges correspond to the
source_ratings they have defined on each other, with attributes
on each edge specifying the actual rating and under which
tag.name the rating was set.
