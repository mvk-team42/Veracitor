.. module:: sample_bounds
    :synopsis: The algorithm used for probabilistic logic sampling in SUNNY (as described by Golbeck and Kuter (2010)).
Computes minimum and maximum probability of success by using a stochastic simulation. Success is in this case defined as being used in the trust evaluation done by SUNNY.
