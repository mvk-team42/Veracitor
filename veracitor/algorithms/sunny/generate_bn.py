"""
The algorithm for generating a probabilistic network, given a trust network,
graph, and two nodes, source and sink (as described by Golbeck and Kuter (2010))

.. note:
   From *Kuter, Golbeck 2010*: 
   The nodes in K returned by GENERATEBN and the edges between those nodes
   constitute the probabilistic network BT as follows. For each node n in K, we
   define a Boolean variable x that denotes the logical proposition that whether n
   believes in the sink node nâˆž. In BT , X is the set of such logical propositions. A
   is the set of all of the edges between the nodes in K, with the directions of those
   edges reversed. Then, we use Equation (1) in order to compute the conditional
   probabilities for every edge in BT .
