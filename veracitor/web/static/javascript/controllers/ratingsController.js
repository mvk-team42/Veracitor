    well as groups, that is defined in the database. All set ratings can be
    altered directly in the list and there will be an option to display a se-
    lected producer in the NetworkView. Producers, users and groups not
    previously rated will be presented in a separate list and will be moved to
    the “rated list” when a rating is set.
